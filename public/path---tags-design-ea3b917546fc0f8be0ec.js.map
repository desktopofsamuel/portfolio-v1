The argument of the cost is equivalent to a cup of coffee in a month has become a lot of coffee. Setapp is also part of the solution (or the problem) by splitting its revenue according to the usage of apps listed in its catalogue if a majority of user’s apps can be found on Setapp.</p>\\n<p>Following the success of iOS App Store revamp last year, Mac App Store is also set for revamp in the next version of MacOS Mojave this fall. Yet, Mac App Store is stepping on the road behind the shadow of iOS App Store, Apple is enhancing the experience on user’s side with better-curated collections and editorial stories to discover new apps. But for developers, channels for distributing are still fragmented.\\nFor now, it is safe to say the subscription model for apps will not arrive soon on App Store just like Apple Music. In fact, Those popular Mac apps that I have listed above, all of them have more than a single channel and licenses to purchase or subscribe. Some of them offer single &#x26; family licenses with paid upgrade options; some are running multi-platform subscription plus Setapp subscription. Biggest sacrifice probably is the users as they have to decide which pricing model is a better bargain for them. But in a longer run, bug fixing and pushing updates across different versions would be a debt for developers to pay.</p>\\n<p>Setapp itself is also facing some fundamental problems on its own. Should its app catalogue strikes for quantity or quality? How to keep up with users’ momentum to try new apps and switch to new workflows? I’ll address this issues in the next article.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Do Subscription Models Work with Apps?\",\"date\":\"Jul 20, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"test\",\"design\",\"technology\"],\"path\":\"/setapp-2\"}}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2018-08-25/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h3>Do Subscription Models Work with Apps?</h3>\\n<h2>Thoughts on Setapp — subscription-based collection for Mac apps</h2>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/8c16986a3a85c875ea06a7eea763e9cb/tumblr_inline_pbzvlwcb3b1vn6aq1_500.png\\\"> </p>\\n<p>Mac apps are great.

The argument of the cost is equivalent to a cup of coffee in a month has become a lot of coffee. Setapp is also part of the solution (or the problem) by splitting its revenue according to the usage of apps listed in its catalogue if a majority of user’s apps can be found on Setapp.</p>\\n<p>Following the success of iOS App Store revamp last year, Mac App Store is also set for revamp in the next version of MacOS Mojave this fall. Yet, Mac App Store is stepping on the road behind the shadow of iOS App Store, Apple is enhancing the experience on user’s side with better-curated collections and editorial stories to discover new apps. But for developers, channels for distributing are still fragmented.\\nFor now, it is safe to say the subscription model for apps will not arrive soon on App Store just like Apple Music. In fact, Those popular Mac apps that I have listed above, all of them have more than a single channel and licenses to purchase or subscribe. Some of them offer single &#x26; family licenses with paid upgrade options; some are running multi-platform subscription plus Setapp subscription. Biggest sacrifice probably is the users as they have to decide which pricing model is a better bargain for them. But in a longer run, bug fixing and pushing updates across different versions would be a debt for developers to pay.</p>\\n<p>Setapp itself is also facing some fundamental problems on its own. Should its app catalogue strikes for quantity or quality? How to keep up with users’ momentum to try new apps and switch to new workflows? I’ll address this issues in the next article.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Do Subscription Models Work with Apps? 2\",\"date\":\"Jul 20, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"test\",\"design\",\"technology\"],\"path\":\"/test-4\"}}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2018-08-25 post/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h3>Book Review</h3>\\n<p>Testing</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Hello How Are You\",\"date\":\"Jul 20, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"test\",\"design\",\"technology\"],\"path\":\"/test-5\"}}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2018-04-24 why real data and content matter/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>We have a lot of assumptions in the process of creating wireframes and mockups for websites &#x26; apps. As wireframes &#x26; mock-ups are not dynamic, it is easy to aware various scenarios when dummy content or placeholders are used.</p>\\n<p>In contrast to graphic design or typesetting, which you build on certain materials delivered by the client. Website &#x26; app is on the other side of the track, it’s like working on a blank canvas at the beginning. Stakeholders like clients &#x26; users have some rough ideas but there is still space that requires our imagination and instinct to predict how people would use them.</p>\\n<p>A lot of tools that help designers to generate filler text easily to imitate a real product. Lorem Ipsum (originated from a sadistic quote in Latin) has become the synonym of dummy text. Tools like <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/littleipsum/id405772121?mt=12\\\">Little Lorem</a> enable quick access to different lengths of text, either by sentence, by line, or by paragraph. But when lorem ipsum is everywhere, it is not a good sign for a sophisticated design. What it really means is you need be more thorough of your design or you will need to revise it after all. I recognized placing them in my design files is actually a lazy step back, and the lesson I learned is to use real data &#x26; content as soon as possible.</p>\\n<p>Here are the reasons why:</p>\\n<h2>Misinformed Design Delays Process</h2>\\n<p>Unless intentional, filler text usually delays my design process. Once lorem is placed, I can hardly get rid of it, especially when I was designing an app with content management system (CMS) or user-generated content. The idea of mock-up text will be replaced by anything, encouraged my mind to do nothing about it.</p>\\n<p>But for the exact same reason, users could also do nothing or confused about it, without context knowing what should they fill in. It would also become developers’ trouble when the draft has been developed. It would take more time and effort to adjust. What if the lorem is not text-only? Or the design incorporated personas photo that most user does not feel like to upload? Getting ahead start to collect actual copy or real sets of data would save you tons of time in the development process.</p>\\n<h2>One Step Ahead To Stop Design Flaws</h2>\\n<p>Using dummy text could also result in design flaws in terms of visual design. I would definitely redesign if article headlines are too long on a blog page, as they affect how the page looks like on a photo background. Button text is also tricky, the space you need placing a “View More” button is not the same as “Read {Blog Title} ”. Using real data would provide a more accurate estimate of the information I am dealing with, resulting in a more informed decision.</p>\\n<h2>Design With Real Data is Designing Reality</h2>\\n<p>What makes mock-up real is not how refined a box shadow is created, but context. How every single detail falls into the right place, that’s how a mock-up straightly takes you in the context. However, working in a web agency that handles clients’ design and feature request every day. Getting information from stakeholders or clients is not an easy task. Most clients come with a business plan or sketchy idea, do not realize the importance of getting the real data.</p>\\n<p>Depending on the scope of work of the project, the step of researching actual data could be an extra effort to the design process, or even it should before design process begin. As <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/bridge-collection/modern-design-tools-using-real-data-62d499e97482\\\">Josh Puckett</a> stated, “ (Designers) allow data to inform and constrain their work. Their decisions are wholly informed; implementation details carefully considered; edge cases solved. They build empathy for how their users will actually experience things in a variety of contexts.”</p>\\n<p>Trying to obtain data is also one step toward practicality. Realistic data that you can obtain eventually will be the data shown on screen. Those you cannot obtain will remain in the fancy template. I worked on an app that showcases tourist destinations, the “editorial” introduction that filled with lorem ipsum has eventually become excerpts from Wikipedia, which have removed after all. With Sketch quick-and-easy plugin (Try <a href=\\\"https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin\\\">Content Generator</a> or <a href=\\\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\\\">Invision’s Craft</a>, inputting dynamic data is easier than ever. Craft even support JSON so any dataset can be imported into the design within clicks.</p>\\n<p>If you are working on a new website / app idea, getting real data is an essential step leads to a better design. It would require collaborative effort from both clients and designers to do so. To me, if I’m doing all my old projects again, this would be the way I choose.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Why real data & content matter\",\"date\":\"Apr 24, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"prototype\",\"design\"],\"path\":\"/design-with-real-data\"}}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2019-04-10 post-one/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h2>Hello World!</h2>\\n<p>Hello world,✌🏻 this is the samuel development site. 😄 </p>\\n<h3>hello</h3>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"First Gatsby Post\",\"date\":\"Apr 10, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"test\",\"design\",\"technology\"],\"path\":\"/post-three\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"tag\":\"design\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---tags-design-ea3b917546fc0f8be0ec.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2018-04-09 post-one/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h3>Do Subscription Models Work with Apps?</h3>\\n<h2>Thoughts on Setapp — subscription-based collection for Mac apps</h2>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/8c16986a3a85c875ea06a7eea763e9cb/tumblr_inline_pbzvlwcb3b1vn6aq1_500.png\\\" class=\\\"testing\\\"></p>\\n<p>Mac apps are great.

Their CEO, Jeff Shiner wrote,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The App Store, for all it does well, struggles mightily when a paid upgrade is introduced because it does not allow developers to charge for an update to an existing app. When considering a paid upgrade, developers have two choices: they can re-use their existing app or submit a new one. Both have their pros and cons.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The third way is not to rely on Mac App Store at all. But to a larger extent, the existence of paid upgrade is originated to the insufficient income for app development.

As wireframes &#x26; mock-ups are not dynamic, it is easy to aware various scenarios when dummy content or placeholders are used.</p>\\n<p>In contrast to graphic design or typesetting, which you build on certain materials delivered by the client. Website &#x26; app is on the other side of the track, it’s like working on a blank canvas at the beginning. Stakeholders like clients &#x26; users have some rough ideas but there is still space that requires our imagination and instinct to predict how people would use them.</p>\\n<p>A lot of tools that help designers to generate filler text easily to imitate a real product. Lorem Ipsum (originated from a sadistic quote in Latin) has become the synonym of dummy text. Tools like <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/littleipsum/id405772121?mt=12\\\">Little Lorem</a> enable quick access to different lengths of text, either by sentence, by line, or by paragraph. But when lorem ipsum is everywhere, it is not a good sign for a sophisticated design. What it really means is you need be more thorough of your design or you will need to revise it after all. I recognized placing them in my design files is actually a lazy step back, and the lesson I learned is to use real data &#x26; content as soon as possible.</p>\\n<p>Here are the reasons why:</p>\\n<h2>Misinformed Design Delays Process</h2>\\n<p>Unless intentional, filler text usually delays my design process. Once lorem is placed, I can hardly get rid of it, especially when I was designing an app with content management system (CMS) or user-generated content. The idea of mock-up text will be replaced by anything, encouraged my mind to do nothing about it.</p>\\n<p>But for the exact same reason, users could also do nothing or confused about it, without context knowing what should they fill in. It would also become developers’ trouble when the draft has been developed. It would take more time and effort to adjust. What if the lorem is not text-only? Or the design incorporated personas photo that most user does not feel like to upload? Getting ahead start to collect actual copy or real sets of data would save you tons of time in the development process.</p>\\n<h2>One Step Ahead To Stop Design Flaws</h2>\\n<p>Using dummy text could also result in design flaws in terms of visual design. I would definitely redesign if article headlines are too long on a blog page, as they affect how the page looks like on a photo background. Button text is also tricky, the space you need placing a “View More” button is not the same as “Read {Blog Title} ”. Using real data would provide a more accurate estimate of the information I am dealing with, resulting in a more informed decision.</p>\\n<h2>Design With Real Data is Designing Reality</h2>\\n<p>What makes mock-up real is not how refined a box shadow is created, but context. How every single detail falls into the right place, that’s how a mock-up straightly takes you in the context. However, working in a web agency that handles clients’ design and feature request every day. Getting information from stakeholders or clients is not an easy task. Most clients come with a business plan or sketchy idea, do not realize the importance of getting the real data.</p>\\n<p>Depending on the scope of work of the project, the step of researching actual data could be an extra effort to the design process, or even it should before design process begin. As <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/bridge-collection/modern-design-tools-using-real-data-62d499e97482\\\">Josh Puckett</a> stated, “ (Designers) allow data to inform and constrain their work. Their decisions are wholly informed; implementation details carefully considered; edge cases solved. They build empathy for how their users will actually experience things in a variety of contexts.”</p>\\n<p>Trying to obtain data is also one step toward practicality. Realistic data that you can obtain eventually will be the data shown on screen. Those you cannot obtain will remain in the fancy template. I worked on an app that showcases tourist destinations, the “editorial” introduction that filled with lorem ipsum has eventually become excerpts from Wikipedia, which have removed after all. With Sketch quick-and-easy plugin (Try <a href=\\\"https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin\\\">Content Generator</a> or <a href=\\\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\\\">Invision’s Craft</a>, inputting dynamic data is easier than ever. Craft even support JSON so any dataset can be imported into the design within clicks.</p>\\n<p>If you are working on a new website / app idea, getting real data is an essential step leads to a better design. It would require collaborative effort from both clients and designers to do so. To me, if I’m doing all my old projects again, this would be the way I choose.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Why real data & content matter\",\"date\":\"Apr 24, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"prototype\",\"design\"],\"path\":\"/design-with-real-data\"}}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2019-04-10 post-one/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h2>Hello World!</h2>\\n<p>Hello world,✌🏻 this is the samuel development site. 😄 </p>\\n<h3>hello</h3>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"First Gatsby Post\",\"date\":\"Apr 10, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"test\",\"design\",\"technology\"],\"path\":\"/post-three\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"tag\":\"design\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/tags-design.json\n// module id = 996\n// module chunks = 65951750749414"],"sourceRoot":""}
