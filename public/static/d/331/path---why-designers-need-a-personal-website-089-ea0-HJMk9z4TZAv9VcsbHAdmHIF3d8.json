I feel that being a designer, learning how to code is the way how I could step up the game in web design, by understanding how every bit and piece fall into places. </p>\n<p><img src=\"./Framev2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I had two personal websites, one is my Tumblr and another is my portfolio site, separately hosted and running <a href=\"https://cargocollective.com/\">Cargo Collective</a>. But I was thinking, \"Wouldn't it be great if both of my portfolio and blog are together?\"</p>\n<h2>Why do you need a personal website?</h2>\n<p>It's 2018. Online presence is becoming the norm, even in the professional field. Your previous work, your side projects, even your work in progress matter. </p>\n<p>A personal site also means more control over your message and story, whether you're looking for new clients, landing a dream job or establishing a personal brand. For sure it takes more time and effort, but I think it is quite a good practice to sharpen your skill and catching up. Needless to say, making a personal site is much easier than a decade ago. </p>\n<p>While platforms like Medium, Facebook Pages are building homogeneous style for coherent browsing / reading experience. Your website should pursue personality instead. I'm not saying you shouldn't post to Medium publications or run a Facebook Page, but just not as the destination but a way to reach your very own website where you deliver your message. </p>\n<h2>What're my options?</h2>\n<p>Speaking of the BIG question, which platform should you choose? Wordpress is great for beginners since all settings are visible without dealing with code. But it was developed as a blogging platform, so it requires specific template in order to create a decent looking personal page. </p>\n<p>Website builder like <a href=\"https://webflow.com/?rfsn=1574887.557b84\">Webflow</a> and <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/\">Squarespace</a> is also an elegant option, but they adopt subscription model so the cost would be definitely higher.  </p>\n<p>After taking the <a href=\"http://designcode.io/\">Design+Code's</a> React course instructed by Meng To, I was introduced to <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby.JS</a>. After trying it out for few weeks, I genuinely rooting it as the up-and-coming personal website &#x26; blog option. Because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A custom personal website allows maximum creativity, a great advantage for designers.</li>\n<li>It's blaze-fast. Because all files are generated already. It also adopts modern web technology like React, Webpack and GraphQL. I compared the Lighthouse audit ran on beta site and current site. Performance has insanely improved.</li>\n<li>Gatsby is a static site generator, but dynamic data source is widely supported. Wordpress, Contentful or even Airtable can be used as a database. </li>\n<li>Deploying is as easy as drag-and-drop. <a href=\"http://netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> provides free hosting for static site, and Gatsby is free, meaning the project could be free as long as you have your own domain.</li>\n<li>Personal reason but a good one. <strong>I admit the process of making your own site is empowering.</strong> It's nice to not rely on anybody and build a website designed and developed all by yourself. I've been taking some screenshots logging daily progress, will share it later.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Last word</h2>\n<p>As Gatsby is quite new since it was first released a year ago. I wouldn't say current resources available is sufficient, but it is a strong and growing community. Most users are frontend web developer right now, but I'm optimistic to see more designers onboard.</p>\n<p>I admit there is indeed a learning curve to React, Gatsby and also GraphQL since I know fundamental HTML and CSS only. There were long nights that I was figuring out causes of errors, which turned out to be some stupid mistakes. </p>\n<p>I'm writing this also for my own future reference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A personal website should not only showcase your work, but also speak who you are and how you work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's why I'm eager to share my work in progress, hoping to launch the site as soon as possible. </p>\n<h5>Reading List:</h5>\n<h5><a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/things-i-honestly-dont-want-to-see-in-your-portfolio-3d3497666ca8\">Things I (honestly) don’t want to see in your portfolio</a></h5>","excerpt":"TLDR: I'm summing up the reasons why a designer should build a custom site using Gatsby.JS.
