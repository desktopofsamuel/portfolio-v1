The convenience of a unified subscription platform, you don’t need your purchase keys anymore or bother to manage license keys on your new and old Macs.\nFor entertainment, the subscription model is a sweet deal, with higher user acceptance rate, but whether app subscription service is a rip-off, remains a bigger controversy. In “ <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fhackernoon.com%2Fsubscription-software-paradox-d4a1aef4d88a&#x26;t=MTQwZTgxZTY0OWE1YjVjMGYzNGFjNDZlOGViMWRmZmY0NGUwMDMzMSxSc3dIQkx3eA%3D%3D&#x26;b=t%3Amd_XHZDWEUh7XzJM6q1d8g&#x26;p=https%3A%2F%2Fjournal.desktopofsamuel.com%2Fpost%2F175975854762%2Fdo-subscription-models-work-with-apps&#x26;m=1">The Subscription App Paradox</a> ”, written by Alan Marsden, digital consumption has become an unnoticeable expense, he spent £84.50 every month on digital subscription service (Apps, Media, VPN). The argument of the cost is equivalent to a cup of coffee in a month has become a lot of coffee. Setapp is also part of the solution (or the problem) by splitting its revenue according to the usage of apps listed in its catalogue if a majority of user’s apps can be found on Setapp.</p>\n<p>Following the success of iOS App Store revamp last year, Mac App Store is also set for revamp in the next version of MacOS Mojave this fall. Yet, Mac App Store is stepping on the road behind the shadow of iOS App Store, Apple is enhancing the experience on user’s side with better-curated collections and editorial stories to discover new apps. But for developers, channels for distributing are still fragmented.\nFor now, it is safe to say the subscription model for apps will not arrive soon on App Store just like Apple Music. In fact, Those popular Mac apps that I have listed above, all of them have more than a single channel and licenses to purchase or subscribe. Some of them offer single &#x26; family licenses with paid upgrade options; some are running multi-platform subscription plus Setapp subscription. Biggest sacrifice probably is the users as they have to decide which pricing model is a better bargain for them. But in a longer run, bug fixing and pushing updates across different versions would be a debt for developers to pay.</p>\n<p>Setapp itself is also facing some fundamental problems on its own. Should its app catalogue strikes for quantity or quality? How to keep up with users’ momentum to try new apps and switch to new workflows? I’ll address this issues in the next article.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Do Subscription Models Work with Apps? 2",date:"Jul 20, 2018",tags:["test","design","technology"],path:"/test-4"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/samuelisme/Code/blog/src/blog/2018-04-09 post-one/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:'<h3>Do Subscription Models Work with Apps?</h3>\n<h2>Thoughts on Setapp — subscription-based collection for Mac apps</h2>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-6357f.jpeg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1280px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 52.900000000000006%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Original Photo by Andrew Garrison on Unsplash"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-71e08.jpeg"\n        srcset="/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-996a7.jpeg 320w,\n/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-06faf.jpeg 640w,\n/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-71e08.jpeg 1280w,\n/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-2ed49.jpeg 1920w,\n/static/1-c87e1650ce97442fd5406cbad04edb56-6357f.jpeg 2000w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Mac apps are great.

The argument of the cost is equivalent to a cup of coffee in a month has become a lot of coffee. Setapp is also part of the solution (or the problem) by splitting its revenue according to the usage of apps listed in its catalogue if a majority of user’s apps can be found on Setapp.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/5-2a039be0886e7bf1b95cb30691d8fdf3-78b8e.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="5"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/5-2a039be0886e7bf1b95cb30691d8fdf3-78b8e.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/5-2a039be0886e7bf1b95cb30691d8fdf3-ca21d.jpg 320w,\n/static/5-2a039be0886e7bf1b95cb30691d8fdf3-4c678.jpg 640w,\n/static/5-2a039be0886e7bf1b95cb30691d8fdf3-78b8e.jpg 1200w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n     Following the success of iOS App Store revamp last year, Mac App Store is also set for revamp in the next version of MacOS Mojave this fall. Yet, Mac App Store is stepping on the road behind the shadow of iOS App Store, Apple is enhancing the experience on user’s side with better-curated collections and editorial stories to discover new apps. But for developers, channels for distributing are still fragmented.\nFor now, it is safe to say the subscription model for apps will not arrive soon on App Store just like Apple Music. In fact, Those popular Mac apps that I have listed above, all of them have more than a single channel and licenses to purchase or subscribe. Some of them offer single &#x26; family licenses with paid upgrade options; some are running multi-platform subscription plus Setapp subscription. Biggest sacrifice probably is the users as they have to decide which pricing model is a better bargain for them. But in a longer run, bug fixing and pushing updates across different versions would be a debt for developers to pay.</p>\n<p>~<a href="./6.jpg"></a></p>\n<p>Setapp itself is also facing some fundamental problems on its own. Should its app catalogue strikes for quantity or quality? How to keep up with users’ momentum to try new apps and switch to new workflows?
