"Road Not Taken" is my first directed feature-length documentary, focusing on the subject of Umbrella Revolution. The filming of “Road Not Taken” started during the student strike in 2014, when I was a student in The University of Hong Kong. It was set to document stories of the youngsters. Billy and Popsy are both students from The University of Hong Kong and they are searching a way out of Hong Kong's political and social desperation. After the premiere in Hong Kong Independent Film Festival, [Campus screening tour](https://www.facebook.com/pg/outfocuspro/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1729950780613724) was held over the year in more than 11 universities and secondary school in Hong Kong.
