###Getting Started.

Living in the bubble of agency model for years taking client projects, I have always imagined to start my own personal project. There were regrets and compromises accommodating with clients’ need and reality and I can’t help but wonder if I can kickstart one on my own.

Therefore, when the idea of building a design resources site strikes me, I immediately started to test out the idea all by myself, putting aside the standard design workflow in my agency (writing specs, wire-framing, creating mockups and handoff to developers). I worked on a prototype of my idea all by myself using Webflow and built a minimum viable product.

It's called Today Dojo, aiming to provide daily resources for designers to step up their game. 

###Quick iteration meaning to adapt faster and better.

I have pivoted 2 times and then rewrote the whole thing for once. The initial idea was to build a browser extension that deliver daily resources to new tab, yet the idea has scaled down to a website first, since content is all that matters.

So initially I used Webflow to experiment the whole project with its own CMS and hosting, which provides a much faster approach on building launch-ready websites instead of static mock-ups. Webflow's customised Content Management System also allows me setup the database with rich media, photos, text, link and date, reference entries (tags and categories). 

###The sooner I kickstart operation, sooner I realise real problems.

All plans sound perfect on paper. The best of building a digital product is that I can get hands-on experience in operation easily and deal with the problems on my own. Initially my plan is to find 10 resources every day, I even built the website layout favouring the content update cycle. But it only takes a week for me to realise such workload is too overwhelming, given that I’m working on part-time basis and the site should value quality over quantity. Webflow allows me to quick adjusting the layout and my schedule easily, lining up with social media and newsletter. 

###Finding the value and sustainability is key.

After the site has launched, writing Medium articles, posting on social media, setting up newsletter did bring adequate traffic to the site. Even though there were plans on monetizing the website, but obviously it was too early to do so. So, a bigger question arises: 

> How do I find time and money to keep it going? 

You'll see there's a cost on using a code-free solution, Webflow's CMS hosting plan cost USD $16 per month alone and if you have more than 2 projects, another USD $16 are required for membership subscription. I'm also finding myself desperately need more time and means to acquire more design resources in order to maintain standard quality. I was striking a balance between acquire new content and expanding on design categories.

###Scaling down is the step up not a step back.

At the same time of launching a curatorial site, I was also learning to code for the first time. What I've learned is to build static site with React app which result great performance and dynamic data passing through. Therefore my solution to resolve financial problem, is to build the site from scratch using [Gatsby.JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), hook up with backend platform [Prismic.io](https://prismic.io). Using Github and Netlify, it is basically free except for the cost to purchase domain. 

However, another thing I did is to roll it back into a subsidiary site under my personal website. Renaming the site with a coherent name and navigation bar makes the experience more unify under my other sites. It also add more regular content to my personal twitter account with human touch, rather than reposting content like a bot. As you might have known,  Running independent social media accounts are a time-consuming effort that doesn't worth it.  

Now the site has renamed to be Pin, and available to browse right now at https://pin.desktopofsamuel.com. Check it out now!
