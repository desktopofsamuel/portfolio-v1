Online presence is becoming the norm, even in the professional field. Your previous work, your side projects, even your work in progress matter. </p>\n<p>A personal site also means more control over your message and story, whether you're looking for new clients, landing a dream job or establishing a personal brand. For sure it takes more time and effort, but I think it is quite a good practice to sharpen your skill and catching up. Needless to say, making a personal site is much easier than a decade ago. </p>\n<p>While platforms like Medium, Facebook Pages are building homogeneous style for coherent browsing / reading experience. Your website should pursue personality instead. I'm not saying you shouldn't post to Medium publications or run a Facebook Page, but just not as the destination but a way to reach your very own website where you deliver your message. </p>\n<h2 id=\"whatre-my-options\"><a href=\"#whatre-my-options\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What're my options?</h2>\n<p>Speaking of the BIG question, which platform should you choose? Wordpress is great for beginners since all settings are visible without dealing with code. But it was developed as a blogging platform, so it requires specific template in order to create a decent looking personal page. </p>\n<p>Website builder like <a href=\"https://webflow.com/?rfsn=1574887.557b84\">Webflow</a> and <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/\">Squarespace</a> is also an elegant option, but they adopt subscription model so the cost would be definitely higher.  </p>\n<p>After taking the <a href=\"http://designcode.io/\">Design+Code's</a> React course instructed by Meng To, I was introduced to <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby.JS</a>. After trying it out for few weeks, I genuinely rooting it as the up-and-coming personal website &#x26; blog option. Because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A custom personal website allows maximum creativity, a great advantage for designers.</li>\n<li>It's blaze-fast. Because all files are generated already. It also adopts modern web technology like React, Webpack and GraphQL. I compared the Lighthouse audit ran on beta site and current site. Performance has insanely improved.</li>\n<li>Gatsby is a static site generator, but dynamic data source is widely supported. Wordpress, Contentful or even Airtable can be used as a database. </li>\n<li>Deploying is as easy as drag-and-drop. <a href=\"http://netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> provides free hosting for static site, and Gatsby is free, meaning the project could be free as long as you have your own domain.</li>\n<li>Personal reason but a good one. <strong>I admit the process of making your own site is empowering.</strong> It's nice to not rely on anybody and build a website designed and developed all by yourself. I've been taking some screenshots logging daily progress, will share it later.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"last-word\"><a href=\"#last-word\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Last word</h2>\n<p>As Gatsby is quite new since it was first released a year ago. I wouldn't say current resources available is sufficient, but it is a strong and growing community. Most users are frontend web developer right now, but I'm optimistic to see more designers onboard.</p>\n<p>I admit there is indeed a learning curve to React, Gatsby and also GraphQL since I know fundamental HTML and CSS only. There were long nights that I was figuring out causes of errors, which turned out to be some stupid mistakes. </p>\n<p>I'm writing this also for my own future reference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A personal website should not only showcase your work, but also speak who you are and how you work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's why I'm eager to share my work in progress, hoping to launch the site as soon as possible. </p>\n<h5 id=\"reading-list\"><a href=\"#reading-list\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reading List:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"things-i-honestly-dont-want-to-see-in-your-portfolio\"><a href=\"#things-i-honestly-dont-want-to-see-in-your-portfolio\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/things-i-honestly-dont-want-to-see-in-your-portfolio-3d3497666ca8\">Things I (honestly) don’t want to see in your portfolio</a></h5>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"TLDR: I'm summing up the reasons why a designer should build a custom site using Gatsby.JS.
